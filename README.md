# JackHenryInterview
Hello to Mr. Farrar and the rest of the Dev Ops team at Jack Henry! Preceeding my first interview on 11/13/2024 I have created this repository that consists of several job-specific projects that I have put together for you all. The goal with these projects is not to show you that I am an "expert" using Powershell, SQL and their respective concepts, but rather to give you an idea of my current skill level surrounding these topics, my ability/desire to learn, and my overall programming aptitude. 

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out!
